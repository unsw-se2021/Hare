you can find out more about doing so here: 
`https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account`)

### To clone this repostiroy:
1. Naviage to the green "Clone or Download" button at the top right
2. Click "SSH" as an option 
3. In your linux terminal, type `git clone git@github.com:unsw-se2021/C.A.D-TEMP-NAME.git <Folder name of your choice>`
4. Enter the directory and verify your clone is complete (`cd <Folder Name; git status`)

If any of the above steps fail, make sure you have properly set up your SSH key for your github, and
that your username/password have been configured on your linux user. 
(i.e `git config --global user.name "Michael-Lloyd"` should have been put down at one point for me)
