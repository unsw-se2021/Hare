# Part 1: Problem statement

"Describe a few problem statements. Remember, while you are allowed to 
explore and negotiate with regard to the problems you are going to absolve, 
the following phases of the project will require you to abide by these requirements. 
Below is a summarised example from previous students, which should be used 
as guidance only." 

```
(1) There is no feedback system for a particular course 

(2) There is no reputation / popularity system forusers or course instructors.

(3) The forums are visually messy. They are cluttered and jumbled up together. 

(4) There is no general forum for the students to interact with each other, 
only a forumfor each individual 

(5) Old course content is removed / hidden, thus not allowing students to 
revisit already covered material.

(6) The dashboard is not interactive enough and lacks information of 
recentactivity from the course.

(7) There is no Intuitive notification system. 

(8) Major social hubs have been integrated poorly into the platform.
```

"It is also possible to formulate a problem statement that targets a particular 
group of users or a community (e.g. teenagers, elderly or region specific)."
